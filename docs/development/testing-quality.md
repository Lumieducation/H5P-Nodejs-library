# Testing and code quality

## Running Tests

After installation, you can run the tests with

```bash
npm run test
npm run test:integration
npm run test:e2e
npm run test:h5p-mongos3 # (require running MongoDB server)
```

You can run the e2e tests with h5p packages on your local system like this:

```bash
H5P_FILES=test/data/hub-content ERROR_FILE=errors.txt npm run test:server+upload
```

## Debugging

The library emits log messages with
[debug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug). To see those messages you have to
set the environment variable `DEBUG` to `h5p:*`. There are several log levels.
By default you'll only see the messages sent with the level `info`. To get the
verbose log, set the environment variable `LOG_LEVEL` to debug (mind the
capitalization).

Example (for Linux):

```bash
DEBUG=h5p:* LOG_LEVEL=debug node script.js
```

## Other scripts

Check out the many other npm scripts in [package.json](/package.json) for other
development functionality.

## Core updates

Check out [this page](core-updates.md) for more details on how to update the
H5P core files when there is a new release of the H5P core or the H5P editor
core.

## Code quality

We aim at achieving high code quality by following these principles:

* All public methods and all classes must contain JSDoc comments that contain a full documentation of the entity's function, all of its parameters and return
  values.
* We try to follow the patterns of object oriented programming.
* All code must be formatted by prettier.
* All code must pass the TS Lint checks.
* Every piece of functionality that is added to the library should be covered by a test.
* When fixing a bug, a test proving that the bug has been fixed should be added to the project whenever possible.
* All logical code branches should be covered by test except.
* All tests should be part of the CI pipeline.
* All code that is merged into master must pass the CI pipeline's tests.

You can check whether your own code passes most of these requirements by running
`npm run ci` (doesn't include tests requiring a database).
