# Architecture

## General overview

A H5P web-application using this library consists of four components, which
communicate between each other:

1. This library ({@link "@lumieducation/h5p-server"} and possibly other
   @lumieducation packages) on the server-side (in yellow below)
2. Your server (implementation of the interfaces of this library + other
   endpoints, in blue below)
3. Your web client (running in the browser, in blue below, {@link
   "@lumieducation/h5p-webcomponents"} and {@link "@lumieducation/h5p-react"}
   can help your here if you want to write a SPA application)
4. Joubel's H5P player / editor client (downloaded by you and served by your
   server, in grey below)

As you can see, this library is not an out-of-the-box solution for all your
needs, but **requires you to implement your own server and web client**.

## Example diagram of the editor

The diagram shows how the four components interact in a selection of use cases.
Each use case has a specific colour and can be traced through the system by it.

![Diagram showing the components at work](editor-architecture.svg)

You have to implement all the components shown in blue. This library ({@link
"@lumieducation/h5p-server"}) provides the parts in yellow and the grey parts
are provided by Joubel's H5P client libraries (downloaded from the PHP
implementation). The Express package ({@link "@lumieducation/h5p-express"})
deals with all AJAX calls by the H5P JavaScript client. You are free to use it,
but can also implement the HTTP endpoints yourself.

Note: The diagram doesn't show a complete list of all use cases and is only
intended to illustrate how everything plays together! There is a lot more
functionality in the packages, which is not listed here.

The player is simpler, as it doesn't have as many endpoints, but works in a
comparable way to the structure in the diagram.

## Example implementation

There is a basic example implementation of the server and client (blue parts)
using Express (and server-side rendering) in the `/packages/h5p-examples`
folder. There is also a more advanced SPA example in the
`/packages/h5p-rest-example-server` and `/packages/h5p-rest-example-client`
folders. Check out the documentation on it [here](../examples/rest/README.md).
