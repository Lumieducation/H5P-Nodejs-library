To find out what this library provides for you and what you must implement on

Then, read about how to [integrate @lumieducation/h5p-server](integrating.md)
into your own NodeJs application.

Next, you must [add several HTTP routes to your application](ajax-endpoints.md)
to serve AJAX requests that are needed by the H5P core to work.

Finally, read about the [options you have when creating an H5PEditor
