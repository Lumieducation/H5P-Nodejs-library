# S3 Temporary file storage

There is an implementation of the `ITemporaryFileStorage` interface that uses a
S3-compatible storage system to store files (images, video, audio etc.) that are
uploaded in the editor. These files are later copied to the permanent content
storage once the users save their changes. You can find it at
[/packages/h5p-mongos3/src/S3TemporaryFileStorage.ts](/packages/h5p-mongos3/src/S3TemporaryFileStorage.ts).

**Note:** You must create the S3 bucket manually before it can be used by
`S3TemporaryFileStorage`! **It's also your responsibility to configure the
bucket to automatically delete old temporary files after a sensible timespan
(e.g. 1 day).**

## Dependencies

The implementation depends on this npm package:

* aws-sdk

**You must add it manually to your application using `npm install aws-sdk`!**

## Usage

You must import the storage implementation via a submodule:

```typescript
import { S3TemporaryFileStorage, initS3 } from '@lumieducation/h5p-mongos3';
```

or in classic JS style:

```javascript
const { S3TemporaryFileStorage, initS3 }  = require('@lumieducation/h5p-mongos3');
```

Initialize the storage implementation like this:

```typescript
const temporaryStorage = new S3TemporaryFileStorage(
    initS3({
        credentials: {
            accessKeyId: 's3accesskey', // optional if env. variable is set
            secretAccessKey: 's3accesssecret' // optional if env. variable is set
        },
        endpoint: 'http://127.0.0.1:9000', // optional if env. variable is set
        region: 'us-east-1' // optional if env. variable is set
        forcePathStyle: true
    }),
    { s3Bucket: 'h5ptemporarybucket' }
);
```

### Notes

* The function [`initS3`](/packages/h5p-mongos3/src/initS3.ts) creates an S3 client using the `aws-sdk` npm package.
* You can pass credentials and other configuration values to `initS3` and through the function parameters. Alternatively you can use these environment variables instead of using the function parameters:
  * AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
  * AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
  * AWS_S3_ENDPOINT
  * AWS_REGION
* You can change the bucket `h5ptemporarybucket` to any name you want, but you  must specify one. You must create the bucket manually before you can use it.
* The configuration object passed into `initS3` is passed on to `aws-sdk`, so you can set any custom configuration values you want.
* To achieve greater configurability, you can decide not to use `initS3` or and instantiate the required client yourself.
* While Amazon S3 supports keys with up to 1024 characters, some other S3 systems such as Minio might only support less in certain situations. To cater for these system you can set the option `maxKeyLength` to the value you need. It defaults to 1024.

## Using S3TemporaryFileStorage in the example

The [example Express application](/packages/h5p-examples/src/express.ts) can be
configured to use the S3 temporary storage by setting the environment variables
from above and these additional variables:

* TEMPORARYSTORAGE=s3
* TEMPORARY_AWS_S3_BUCKET

An example call would be:

```bash
TEMPORARYSTORAGE=s3 AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=minioaccesskey AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=miniosecret AWS_S3_ENDPOINT="http://127.0.0.1:9000" TEMPORARY_AWS_S3_BUCKET=h5ptemporarybucket npm start
```

## Customizing permissions

By default the storage implementation allows all users read access to all files
and every use can create new temporary files! It is very possible that this is
not something you want! You can add a function to the options object of the
constructor of `S3TemporayStorage` to customize access restrictions:

```typescript
    getPermissions: (
        userId: string,
        filename?: string
    ) => Promise<Permission[]>;
```

The function receives the userId of the user who is trying to access a filename.
It must return a list of permissions the user has on the file. Your
implementation of this function will probably be an adapter that hooks into your
rights and permission system.
