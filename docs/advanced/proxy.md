# Forward proxy support

{@link "@lumieducation/h5p-server"} has to make outgoing HTTPS requests to
contact the H5P Hub. If your network requires the use of a forward proxy to
reach the Internet, you must configure the used classes to use it for the HTTPS
requests.

There are two ways of enabling the proxy:

1. Set the `proxy` property in {@link @lumieducation/h5p-server!IH5PConfig} like
   this:

    ```json
    {
        "proxy": {
            "host": "10.1.2.3",
            "port": 8080,
            "protocol": "https" // can also be left out or set to "http" if your proxy can't be accessed with https
        }
    }
    ```

2. Set the HTTPS_PROXY environment variable like this:

    `HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.1.2.3:8080`
    or
    `HTTPS_PROXY=https://10.1.2.3:8080`

    (depending on whether your proxy can be accessed with https).
