# Privacy when using @lumieducation/h5p-server as part of your application

You can use the following information to make sure you comply with your local
regulations (e.g. GDPR). You can base your privacy declaration on parts of it.

**Note that this list was compiled to the best knowledge of the contributor, but
that the contributor cannot provide a legal guarantee that the information is

was created and these changes might not be reflected in this document. In doubt
you should consult the source code yourself and make sure the information
provided here is correct!**

## Stored personal data

The library itself does not store personal data as such. For example it keeps no
user directory.

## Processed personal data

The implementation passes some personal data to {@link
"@lumieducation/h5p-server"} for H5P to work properly. This data is used in
several places by the system and might also be visible to the user (and in the
future: other users).

- the user's id
- the real name of the user (full name)
- the language used by user
- rights and permissions of the user (in general and relating to content)

## Usage-based personal data

When the user does certain actions in the system, the following data is stored
(if the user chooses to do so):

- h5p content objects
    - includes all personal data entered by the user as metadata (e.g. revision
      history, description, etc.)
    - includes user id of creator
    - includes creation date and time
    - (if applicable) includes media contained in it
- uploaded resources (images, videos etc.)
    - includes user id of the user who uploaded the file
    - includes upload date and time

### Retention times

- h5p content objects: kept until explicitly deleted by the implementation
- uploaded resources:
    - kept until corresponding h5p content object is deleted
    - temporary files (used in the editor) are automatically deleted after the
      time set in {@link
      @lumieducation/h5p-server!IH5PConfig.temporaryFileLifetime |
      temporaryFileLifetime in IH5PConfig} (defaults to 120 min); **If you use
      the S3 storage backend, you have to configure automatic deletion of
      temporary files yourself!**

### Logging

At the moment, the library does not include a component that logs user actions
at the domain level. However, if you start the library in debug mode, it emits a
log which might contain personal information (all of the data mentioned in the
sections above). It is not recommended to turn on debugging in a production
environment that processes real user data.

### Communication with 3rd party Internet servers

The {@link "@lumieducation/h5p-server"} **package** (on the server) communicates
with the official H5P Hub at h5p.org to retrieve the current list of available
content types and to download new or updated content types from the H5P Hub.
When first contacting the H5P Hub, the @lumieducation/h5p-server requests the
creation of a unique id **for the server**, which is then transmitted to the H5P
Hub on every content type list update. It also transmits the following
information about your server:

- the IP address of the server
- the supported core API version of H5P
- the version of the PHP implementation the server imitates
- a local id of the server (a hash value of the path of the server files)
- that the server runs on @lumieducation/h5p-server and with which version
- whether the site is a localhost, in a private network or accessible in the

    Internet (configured by you in your implementation of {@link
    @lumieducation/h5p-server!IH5PConfig})

When using the H5P Editor, **the browser** requests files from several 3rd party
servers. This means the user's IP address and other data included in a HTTP
request is transmitted to these servers.

- fonts.googleapis.com (to download fonts)
- fonts.gstatic.com (to download fonts)
- h5p.org (to download image resources for the hub)

Due to the open and modular nature of H5P it is impossible to fully list what
every content type does. You should be aware of the fact that some H5P content
types access resources from 3rd party servers in the browser through AJAX calls
or direct references, which means the IP address and other metadata is
transmitted to these server. Content types like 'speak the words' transmit
personal data (the user's voice) to 3rd party server (Google in this case, if
the user's browser is Google Chrome). **It is your responsibility to check and
document what individual content types you choose to install on your server do
with your users' data!**
