## Additional related packages

@lumieducation/h5p-express is one of several packages by Lumi Education that
work in conjunction to simplify creating H5P applications. They are all managed
in the [h5p-nodejs-library monorepo on
GitHub](https://github.com/lumieducation/h5p-nodejs-library) and are available
on NPM.

## Versioning

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. The versions of all packages
of the monorepo are all increased at the same time, so you should always update
all packages at once. For the versions available, see the [tags on this
